# System Design Basics

System design is an essential process in software engineering that involves designing a software system’s architecture, components, interfaces, and data management strategies. A well-designed system can improve the system’s overall performance, user experience, and security while reducing development costs and time.

In this section, you will get an introduction about the system design topic and an overview of various types and significance of system design in the software industry. You will also get an idea of the impact of system design on software development, maintenance, and overall system performance.

## What is system design?

Software system design is the process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system to satisfy specified requirements.

### Software Design

A software system is a collection of software components, modules, and programs that work together to perform a specific task or set of tasks. It typically includes a set of interrelated software applications that work together to provide a desired functionality, such as managing data, processing transactions, or delivering a service to end users.

It can be as simple as a single program or as complex as a distributed system that spans multiple computing devices and networks.

A software system is designed, developed, and maintained by software engineers, who use various tools, programming languages, and methodologies to ensure that the system is reliable, scalable, and secure. The software system may also require regular updates and maintenance to keep it functioning properly and to address any issues or bugs that arise over time.

### Distributed software system

A distributed software system consists of multiple independent components, processes, or nodes that communicate and coordinate with each other to achieve a common goal. Unlike a centralized software system, where all the components are located on a single machine, a distributed software system is spread across multiple machines, networks, and geographical locations.

Each component in a distributed software system is responsible for a specific task or set of tasks, and they work together to achieve a common goal. The components communicate with each other using a variety of communication protocols, such as remote procedure calls (RPCs), message passing, or publish-subscribe mechanisms.

Distributed software systems are often used in large-scale applications where scalability, availability, and fault tolerance are critical requirements. Examples of distributed software systems include cloud computing platforms, peer-to-peer networks, distributed databases, and content delivery networks (CDNs).

Designing, developing, and maintaining a distributed software system can be challenging because it requires careful consideration of network communication, data consistency, availability, fault tolerance, and security.
