# System Design Basics

System design is an essential process in software engineering that involves designing a software system’s architecture, components, interfaces, and data management strategies. A well-designed system can improve the system’s overall performance, user experience, and security while reducing development costs and time.

In this section, you will get an introduction about the system design topic and an overview of various types and significance of system design in the software industry. You will also get an idea of the impact of system design on software development, maintenance, and overall system performance.

## What is System Design?

Software system design is the process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system to satisfy specified requirements.

### Software Design

A software system is a collection of software components, modules, and programs that work together to perform a specific task or set of tasks. It typically includes a set of interrelated software applications that work together to provide a desired functionality, such as managing data, processing transactions, or delivering a service to end users.

It can be as simple as a single program or as complex as a distributed system that spans multiple computing devices and networks.

A software system is designed, developed, and maintained by software engineers, who use various tools, programming languages, and methodologies to ensure that the system is reliable, scalable, and secure. The software system may also require regular updates and maintenance to keep it functioning properly and to address any issues or bugs that arise over time.

### Distributed Software System

A distributed software system consists of multiple independent components, processes, or nodes that communicate and coordinate with each other to achieve a common goal. Unlike a centralized software system, where all the components are located on a single machine, a distributed software system is spread across multiple machines, networks, and geographical locations.

Each component in a distributed software system is responsible for a specific task or set of tasks, and they work together to achieve a common goal. The components communicate with each other using a variety of communication protocols, such as remote procedure calls (RPCs), message passing, or publish-subscribe mechanisms.

Distributed software systems are often used in large-scale applications where scalability, availability, and fault tolerance are critical requirements. Examples of distributed software systems include cloud computing platforms, peer-to-peer networks, distributed databases, and content delivery networks (CDNs).

Designing, developing, and maintaining a distributed software system can be challenging because it requires careful consideration of network communication, data consistency, availability, fault tolerance, and security.

### Understanding System Design

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and interactions of a software system to meet its functional and non-functional requirements. It involves transforming a set of requirements into a blueprint or a plan that describes how the software system will be structured, implemented, and maintained.

The goal of software system design is to create a design that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend and that meets the performance, scalability, reliability, and security requirements of the system. The design should also be flexible enough to accommodate changes in the requirements or the environment over time.

The software system design process typically involves the following steps:

* Requirements analysis: Understanding and defining the functional and non-functional requirements of the system. This step also calls for a deeper look into the read-and-write patterns and then designing the system to take advantage of these patterns.
* High-level architecture design: Defining the overall structure of the system (see Figure 1.2), including its components, modules, and interfaces.
* Detailed design: Defining the internal structure and behavior of each component and module. This also involves the core algorithms of each component and mechanisms of interactions between components.
* User interface design: Designing the user interface of the system that would interact with the backend services via APIs. This is to be done at a very high level.
* API design: Defining proper APIs, which would enable the user interface or the frontend to interact with the backend services.
* Database design: Designing the data structures and storage mechanisms used by the system. The database could be simple file storage to a relational database such as MySQL or a NoSQL database such as HBase or Cassandra.

The output of the software system design process is a set of design documents, such as architectural diagrams and detailed design documents, enlisting and defining the APIs and user interface prototypes, which serve as a blueprint for implementing the software system.

## What are the types of system design?

There are essentially two types of system design: architectural design, also referred to as high-level system design, and detailed design, also referred to as low-level system design.

### High-level system design

The key aspects of high-level system design include the following:

* System architecture: The overall structure of the system, including its components, relationships, and communication patterns
* Data flow: The movement of data through the system, from ingestion to storage and processing
* Scalability: The ability of the system to handle increased workloads without significant degradation in performance
* Fault tolerance: The capacity of the system to continue functioning despite failures or errors

Let us look at each of these aspects in some more detail.

#### System architecture

A crucial aspect of high-level system design is defining the overall architecture, which outlines the main components, their relationships, and communication patterns. Some popular architectural patterns include the following:

* Monolithic: A single, self-contained application that combines all system components
* Client-server: A distributed architecture where clients request services from one or more servers
* Microservices: A modular architecture with small, independent services that communicate over a network
* Event-driven: A system where components communicate through asynchronous events or messages

When designing a system architecture, consider the following factors:

* Scalability: Will the architecture support the system’s growth in terms of users, data, and functionality?
* Maintainability: How easy will it be to update, debug, or enhance the system?
* Reliability: Can the architecture ensure the system’s uptime, fault tolerance, and resilience?
* Latency: How will the architecture affect the system’s response time and performance?

High-level system design focuses on the clarity of system architectural choices. Let us now look into the next aspect, the flow of the data in the system.

#### Data flow

Understanding how data flows through the system is another essential aspect of high-level system design. A well-designed data flow ensures that the system can ingest, process, store, and retrieve data efficiently. When designing the data flow, consider the following:

* Data ingestion: Identify the sources of data and the mechanisms for ingesting it into the system (e.g., APIs, streaming, or batch processing).
* Data storage: Determine the appropriate storage solutions for the data, considering factors such as access patterns, query performance, and consistency requirements.
* Data processing: Design the processes that transform, analyze, or aggregate the data, considering the necessary compute resources and potential bottlenecks.
* Data retrieval: Define how the processed data is accessed by clients or other components, considering latency, caching, and load balancing strategies.

Data flow directly impacts system performance, scale, and usability. Hence, it is important to make the right choices in selecting and/or designing the data flow subsystems.

#### Scalability

Scalability is a critical aspect of high-level system design, as it determines the system’s ability to handle increased workloads without significant degradation in performance. There are two primary types of scalability:

* Vertical scalability: Improving performance by adding resources to a single component, such as increasing CPU, memory, or storage
* Horizontal scalability: Improving performance by distributing the workload across multiple components or instances, such as adding more servers to a cluster

When designing for scalability, we must consider load balancing, caching, data partitioning, and exploring stateless services. Let us look at the final aspect of high-level system design, that is, fault tolerance.

#### Fault tolerance

Fault tolerance is the system’s ability to continue functioning despite failures or errors in its components. A fault-tolerant system is more reliable and less prone to downtime. Some key strategies for designing fault-tolerant systems include replication, redundancy, graceful degradation, monitoring, and self-healing.

In short, high-level system design focuses on the high-level architecture of the system and does not delve into the implementation and optimizations. Let us now explore low-level system design.

### Low-level system design

Low-level system design focuses on the implementation details of the system’s components. This includes selecting appropriate algorithms, data structures, and APIs to optimize performance, memory usage, and code maintainability.

Key aspects of low-level system design include the following:

* Algorithms: The step-by-step procedures for performing calculations, data processing, and problem-solving
* Data structures: The organization and management of data in memory
* APIs: The interfaces that enable communication between different components or services
* Code optimization: Techniques to improve code performance, readability, and maintainability

Let us now look into each of these aspects in some more detail.

#### Algorithms

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for performing calculations, data processing, and problem-solving in low-level system design. Choosing efficient algorithms is essential to optimize the system’s performance, resource usage, and maintainability. When selecting an algorithm, consider the following factors:

* Time complexity: The relationship between the input size and the number of operations the algorithm performs
* Space complexity: The relationship between the input size and the amount of memory the algorithm consumes
* Trade-offs: The balance between time and space complexity, depending on the system’s requirements and constraints

Writing an optimized algorithm is a far better choice than leveraging high-end machines in any system. Hence, it is one of the core pillars of a robust system. Algorithms can be optimized by the use of appropriate data structures, which we will cover next.

#### Data structures

Data structures are used to organize and manage data in memory, impacting the system’s performance and resource usage. Choosing appropriate data structures is crucial for low-level system design. When selecting a data structure, consider the following factors:

* Access patterns: The frequency and nature of data access, including reads, writes, and updates
* Query performance: The time complexity of operations such as search, insertion, and deletion
* Memory usage: The amount of memory required to store the data structure and its contents

Some common data structures used in system design include arrays, linked lists, hash tables, trees, and graphs.

#### APIs

Application programming interfaces (APIs) are essential for communication between different components or services in a system. They define the contracts that enable components to interact while maintaining modularity and separation of concerns. When designing APIs, consider the following factors:

* Consistency: Ensure that the API design is consistent across all components, making it easy to understand and use
* Flexibility: Design the API to support future changes and extensions without breaking existing functionality
* Security: Implement authentication, authorization, and input validation to protect the system from unauthorized access and data breaches
* Performance: Optimize the API for low latency and efficient resource usage

Having clean and clear APIs is often an enabler to building backward-compatible systems.

#### Code optimization

Code optimization refers to techniques that improve code performance, readability, and maintainability. In low-level system design, code optimization is essential for ensuring that the system performs well under real-world conditions. Some code optimization techniques include the following:

* Refactoring: Restructure the code to improve its readability and maintainability without changing its functionality
* Loop unrolling: Replace repetitive loop structures with a series of statements, reducing loop overhead and improving performance
* Memorization: Reduce time to recompute results by storing the results of previous calls
* Parallelism: Break down tasks into smaller, independent subtasks that can be executed concurrently, reducing overall processing time
